# ASR-Data-Augmentation
Unveiling the Power of Data Augmentation: Enhancing ASR Performance with the Fine-Tuned Whisper Model


This research examines the impact of data augmentation techniques on ASR performance using the Whisper model. Specifically, TimeStretch and PitchShift techniques are explored for their ability to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. Specifically, TimeStretch and PitchShift techniques are examined, while the Gain technique is found to be ineffective and potentially detrimental to ASR accuracy. The findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate augmentation methods that simulate natural speech variations and avoid artificial artifacts that can degrade ASR performance. This study emphasizes the importance of data augmentation in optimizing ASR tasks, contributing valuable insights for future advancements in speech recognition technology.
